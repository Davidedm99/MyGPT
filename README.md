# MyGPT
A simple app that uses openAI API to work as ChatGPT. I tryed to copy the OpenAI style and even recreate a fake left side bar containing the history of chats in order to give a more realistic chatGPT impression, hope you like it and that it can be useful! <br>

This app was at first deployed using my personal API key and since I had no way to hide it easily without letting the app work, if you want to use it for yourself just go to [OpenAi website](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) and request you own API Key (they grant you a free one but has limited usage).<br>
Then you can add it inside the apiKey variable in the Javascript file in order to let the app work, hope you enjoy it! :smile: <br>
Thanks :bow:
