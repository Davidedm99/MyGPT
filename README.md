# MyGPT
A simple app that uses openAI API to work as ChatGPT. I tryed to copy the OpenAI style and even recreate a fake left side bar containing the history of chats in order to give a more realistic chatGPT impression, hope you like it and that it can be useful! <br>

<h3>:bangbang:(DISCLAIMER):bangbang:</h3>
This app uses my personal API key and I have no way to hide it easily without letting the app work, please don't abuse the functionality and don't steal the key! <br>
Thanks :bow:
